R is not a fast language. This is not an accident. R was purposely designed to make data analysis and statistics easier for you to do. It was not designed to make life easier for your computer. While R is slow compared to other programming languages, for most purposes, it's fast enough. In this chapter, you'll learn about some of the trade-offs that R has made, valuing flexibility over performance. Let's get started by learning more about why R is slow.

If you'd like to learn more about the performance characteristics of the R-language and how they affect real code, I highly recommend _"Evaluating the Design of the R Language"_ [@r-design]. It uses a powerful methodology that combines a modified R interpreter and a wide set of code found in the wild.
